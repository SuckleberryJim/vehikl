# LangChain: a gentle, practical intro

LangChain is a Python (and TS) library that helps you build apps around large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. It provides ready-made building blocks so you can connect LLMs to data, tools, and memory, and then compose those pieces into useful workflows without starting from scratch.

Think of LangChain as Lego for language apps:

- The LLM is the “brain.”
- Prompts are the instruction manuals you give the brain.
- Chains are step-by-step recipes the brain follows.
- Tools are external abilities (like a calculator or search).
- Agents are autonomous controllers that decide which tool or step to use next.
- Memory is the ability to remember past chats or context.
- Vector stores and document loaders help the brain read and remember information from documents.

Below is a friendly, hands-on tour with small, copy-pasteable examples.

______________________________________________________________________

## Core concepts (in plain terms)

- LLMs: The “thinking” engine. You can pair LangChain with OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.

- Prompts and PromptTemplates: The instructions you give the LLM. Templates let you reuse common prompts.

- Chains: A fixed sequence of steps that processes input, calls the LLM, and post-processes results. Think: a recipe.

- Tools: External capabilities the system can call, such as a calculator, a search engine, or a Python REPL. Tools wrap real APIs or code.

- Agents: More flexible controllers. Given a goal, they decide which tool or step to use and when, possibly asking the LLM for a plan.

- Memory: Persisting context across interactions (so it feels like a conversation).

- Vector stores + Embeddings: Turn documents into searchable vectors so the system can retrieve relevant information quickly.

- Document loaders: Ingests documents (PDFs, webpages, text files) so the LLM can read them.

______________________________________________________________________

## A tiny hands-on example: a simple prompt-based chain

This example shows a straightforward chain: we ask a question, and the LLM answers with a short response. We’ll use a prompt template to keep things clean.

Install (basic + OpenAI dependency):

- pip install langchain
- You’ll also typically need an OpenAI API key for the LLM. Set it as an environment variable or pass it in code.

Code: simple question-answer chain

```python
# Simple, direct LangChain chain: LLM + prompt template

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Initialize the LLM (you need an OpenAI API key; avoid hard-coding keys)
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)  # adjust model and params as you like

# Create a reusable prompt template
template = """Question: {question}
Answer:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["question"], template=template)

# Build a chain: it fills the prompt and asks the LLM
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain
question = "What is LangChain in simple terms?"
answer = chain.run({"question": question})

print(answer)
```

Notes:

- The chain encapsulates the flow: fill the template, call the LLM, return the result.
- You can tweak temperature for creativity vs. accuracy.
- In a real app, you’d also handle errors, manage API keys, etc.

______________________________________________________________________

## A slightly more useful example: memory + chat

Let’s make a small chat that remembers what was said earlier. We’ll use a memory component so the model can reference past turns.

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Use a chat model (e.g., GPT-4o or GPT-4)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)

# Memory holds the conversation history
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

# A conversation chain ties the LLM + memory together
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory, verbose=True)

# Interact
print(conversation.run("Hello! What's your name?"))
print(conversation.run("Nice to meet you. Tell me a joke."))
```

What happens:

- The first user message is answered.
- The memory stores the turn.
- The second message is answered with context from the earlier turn (the model can reference it).

______________________________________________________________________

## Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): bring in documents

If you have documents (PDFs, webpages, notes) and want the model to answer questions using that content, you typically:

1. load and index the documents,
1. search (retrieve) relevant chunks,
1. ask the LLM to answer using those chunks.

Code sketch (requires embeddings + a vector store, e.g., FAISS):

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# 1) Load documents from a folder
loader = DirectoryLoader("docs/", glob="**/*.txt")  # or .pdf, .md, etc.
docs = loader.load()

# 2) Create embeddings and a vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)

# 3) Create a retriever to fetch relevant chunks
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})

# 4) Build a QA chain that uses the retriever
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever)

# 5) Ask a question
query = "Summarize the main findings in the documents about LangChain."
response = qa_chain.run(query)

print(response)
```

Notes:

- This is a simple RAG setup: you retrieve a few relevant chunks, then the LLM composes an answer.
- You may tune the vector store, embedding model, and the LLM prompt for better results.

______________________________________________________________________

## Agents and Tools: let the system decide what to do

Agents allow the system to choose actions (tools) to reach a goal. A classic setup uses a few Tools (like a calculator or Python shell) and a planner that reasons about which tool to use.

Example concept (simplified):

```python
from langchain.agents import OpenAIFunctionsTools, initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.tools import PythonREPLTool

# Define tools (here, a Python REPL tool for calculations and code)
tools = [
    Tool(name="Python REPL", func=PythonREPLTool().run, description="Execute Python code and return the result.")
]

# LLM and agent
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.0)

# Initialize a basic agent with a React-like description
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

# Run a task
print(agent.run("What is the result of 12 * (3 + 7) ?"))
```

Notes:

- Tools wrap real APIs or code executors. You can add a calculator, a search tool, a weather API, etc.
- Agents can plan steps: e.g., “First check the result with Python, then explain the answer.”
- The exact initialization API may vary by LangChain version. The idea is to supply tools and a capable LLM, and let the agent figure out the plan.

______________________________________________________________________

## A quick install and version note

- Basic install: pip install langchain
- Optional (recommended for real usage):
  - pip install openai
  - pip install "faiss-cpu" # for FAISS vector store on CPU (or install GPU version)
  - pip install chromadb # alternative vector store
- LangChain has evolved; API names differ between v0.x and v2.x. The concepts stay the same, but you may see:
  - from langchain.chains import LLMChain, ConversationChain, RetrievalQA
  - from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
  - from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
  - and so on.
- If you’re following a tutorial, check the version they target and adapt imports accordingly.

______________________________________________________________________

## When to use LangChain (practical guidance)

- You want to build a chatbot that answers questions using a specific knowledge base (docs, PDFs).
- You need a workflow where an LLM decides to call a tool (calculator, search, code execution) automatically.
- You want to add memory so the bot remembers past interactions.
- You want to experiment with retrieval from documents to ground answers in actual data.

______________________________________________________________________

## Quick tips and pitfalls

- API keys: never hard-code your API keys in code you share. Use environment variables or a secret manager.
- Latency and cost: LLM calls can be slow and expensive. Start with small prompts and keep the model temperature low for precise outputs.
- Tool design: Keep tools narrowly scoped and well-documented. A good Tool has a clear name, a description, and a reliable function signature.
- Version differences: If you copy-paste examples from tutorials, verify that the imports and initialization APIs match your LangChain version.
- Testing: Use small, deterministic prompts (low temperature) while you’re developing to get stable results.

______________________________________________________________________

## Next steps

- Build a small project: a document-aware QA bot for a manual or set of PDFs you own.
- Add memory to keep a running conversation, so users feel heard.
- Upgrade to an Agent setup and experiment with at least two tools (e.g., Python REPL and a calculator).
- Experiment with a vector store (FAISS, Chroma, or others) to add retrieval-based answers.

If you’d like, tell me what you want to build (e.g., a FAQ bot, a document QA assistant, or a research assistant), and I’ll tailor a concrete, runnable starter project for you with step-by-step code and explanations.

------------ ### HUMAN ### -------------

what is the best way to master langchain? it feels like drinking from a firehose trying to understand everything all at once, where should I begin and what should I build first to establish a strong foundation of skills?

-------------- ### AI ### --------------

You're not alone feeling like LangChain is a firehose. It’s a big library with lots of moving parts. A practical, step-by-step approach helps you build real skills without drowning in the details.

Below is a focused learning plan to master LangChain efficiently. It starts with the core ideas and then guides you through a sequence of small, runnable projects that build confidence and skills, week by week.

1. Core idea: how to think about LangChain

- LLMs are the thinking engine. LangChain helps you connect that engine to prompts, memory, data, and tools.
- The library is built around a few recurring patterns:
  - Prompts and PromptTemplates: how you ask the model.
  - Chains: a fixed sequence of steps to transform input into output.
  - Memory: preserving context across interactions.
  - Retrieval (vector stores + embeddings): grounding answers in documents.
  - Tools/Agents: letting the system call external actions (calculator, search, code execution) autonomously.
- The right way to learn is by building small things end-to-end, then incrementally adding complexity.

2. Start with three tiny, essential patterns
   Build these in isolation, then combine them.

- Pattern A: LLMChain with a PromptTemplate
  - What it teaches: how to format prompts and call an LLM.
  - Minimal example (already runnable with an API key):

```python
# Pattern A: LLMChain + PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# 1) Set up the LLM
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)  # needs OPENAI_API_KEY

# 2) Create a reusable prompt template
template_text = "Question: {question}\nAnswer:"
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["question"], template=template_text)

# 3) Build the chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# 4) Run
response = chain.run({"question": "Explain LangChain in simple terms."})
print(response)
```

- Pattern B: Conversation memory (remembering past turns)
  - What it teaches: how to keep context across turns so the model “remembers.”
  - Minimal example:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

conv = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory, verbose=True)

print(conv.run("Hello! What's your name?"))
print(conv.run("Tell me a joke."))
```

- Pattern C: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) basics
  - What it teaches: how to fetch relevant docs and answer with them.
  - Minimal skeleton (no heavy setup, just the flow):

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# 1) Load docs
loader = DirectoryLoader("docs/", glob="**/*.txt")
docs = loader.load()

# 2) Embeddings + vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)

# 3) Retriever + QA chain
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever)

# 4) Ask a question
print(qa.run("Summarize the main ideas in the docs."))
```

Quick takeaway: Pattern A teaches how prompts work; Pattern B adds memory; Pattern C adds grounding in data. Mastery comes from chaining these patterns in small projects.

3. A practical 4-6 week plan (structured, beginner-friendly)
   Goal: finish with a solid foundation and a couple of working projects you can extend.

Week 1: Fundamentals

- Learn the three patterns above (A, B, C).
- Practice small prompts and observe how temperature, max tokens, and prompt wording affect outputs.
- Mini project: a simple Q&A bot using LLMChain (Pattern A) that answers questions about a specific topic you care about (e.g., your product or a hobby).
- Deliverable: a single-file script that takes a question and returns an answer.

Week 2: Memory and Conversation

- Add memory to your Q&A bot (Pattern B).
- Extend to a multi-turn chat where responses reference earlier turns.
- Mini project: a memory-enabled chat assistant that can answer questions about a provided context and remember past topics.
- Deliverable: a chat loop with memory saved to disk (optional).

Week 3: Document grounding with RAG basics

- Build a small knowledge base by loading a few PDFs or text files.
- Use a vector store to retrieve relevant chunks and answer with RAG (Pattern C).
- Mini project: a document-aware FAQ bot for your own docs.
- Deliverable: a runnable script that loads docs, answers questions, and prints sources.

Week 4: Tools and simple Agents (optional intro)

- Introduce a simple tool (calculator) and a basic agent scaffold.
- Mini project: a calculator-enabled assistant that can do math via a Python tool.
- Deliverable: an agent that can decide to use a tool based on the user’s question.

Week 5-6: Polish, test, and small domain project

- Build a slightly more polished demo: a document-grounded assistant with memory and a simple CLI or web UI (streamlit, a minimal Flask route, or just a CLI loop).
- Focus on stability: error handling, sensible defaults, and cost-aware prompts.
- Deliverable: a runnable project with a README and a quick start guide.

4. First concrete project you can ship quickly
   Project: Document-grounded chat with memory (a small FAQ for your own docs)

- What it does: you upload a set of docs (text, PDFs), and you can chat with the system. It retrieves relevant chunks and maintains conversation history.
- What you’ll learn:
  - How to ingest documents (DocumentLoaders).
  - Grounding with a vector store (embeddings + FAISS or another store).
  - Memory to maintain a helpful conversation.
  - A simple, repeatable structure you can extend to agents later.

Minimal runnable scaffold (adjust for your docs and API keys):

```python
# Doc-chat with memory (minimal, end-to-end)
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# 1) Load docs
loader = DirectoryLoader("docs/", glob="**/*.txt")
docs = loader.load()

# 2) Vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})

# 3) LLM + retrieval QA
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever)

# 4) Memory (optional: wrap the QA in memory if you want a chat history)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

def chat_with_docs(question: str):
    answer = qa.run(question)
    return answer

# Run a chat loop
print("Ask a question about the docs (type 'exit' to quit):")
while (q := input("> ")) != "exit":
    print(chat_with_docs(q))
```

Notes:

- Replace "docs/" with your folder of PDFs or text files.
- You’ll need an OpenAI API key (set OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment).
- This is a minimal starting point; you can wrap it in a CLI, UI, or integrate memory more deeply later.

5. How to learn without getting overwhelmed

- Start with small, concrete goals (one pattern at a time).
- Avoid trying to master “everything LangChain” at once. Build a few working patterns and then layer in complexity.
- Read little, code a lot: pick a pattern, implement it, and modify parameters to observe changes.
- Keep a running repo of tiny experiments with notes about what you learned.
- Use versions intentionally: pick a stable LangChain version (e.g., v2.x if that’s your target) and stick to its API in a mini project before upgrading.

6. Version, docs, and gotchas

- LangChain APIs evolve. Always pin a version in your project (pip install langchain==X.Y.Z).
- Start with the official docs for the version you’re using. Refer to:
  - Core concepts (Prompts, Chains, Memory, Retrieval, Tools/Agents)
  - Tutorials for LLMChain, ConversationChain, RetrievalQA
- Typical gotchas:
  - API keys and rate limits
  - Model selection and cost (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5)
  - Memory semantics (how memory_key affects storage)
  - Differences between v0.x and v2.x if you’re following older tutorials

7. Suggested learning resources

- LangChain official docs (start with getting started)
- Short, focused examples in LangChain examples repo
- YouTube walkthroughs on building a chat bot with LangChain
- Community examples: small, domain-specific projects you can replicate and adapt

8. Quick-start checklist

- [ ] Install LangChain and a compatible LLM backend (OpenAI)
- [ ] Build Pattern A: a simple LLMChain with a PromptTemplate
- [ ] Extend to Pattern B: add ConversationBufferMemory
- [ ] Extend to Pattern C: add document grounding with a vector store
- [ ] Build a small project (document-grounded chat) you can demo
- [ ] Add a basic tool/agent later if you want autonomy (calculator, Python REPL)

If you’d like, tell me:

- what you want to build (FAQ bot, document QA, personal assistant, etc.),
- what data you have (PDFs, webpages, notes),
- and which environment you’re using (local Python script, notebook, or a tiny web UI).

I can tailor a concrete, runnable 2–3 week plan with exact file structure, code templates, and a step-by-step milestone checklist.

------------ ### HUMAN ### -------------

does langchain have built-in tools? like a web search tool or coding repl that an agent can use? how about built-in memory? how about document loaders for txt, md, and pdf files?

-------------- ### AI ### --------------

Yes. LangChain ships with a number of built-in pieces you can reuse directly in agents, memory, and data ingestion. Here’s a clear breakdown of what’s available and how to use them, plus simple code you can copy-paste.

1. Built-in tools that an agent can use

- What they are: Tools wrap external capabilities (APIs, code execution, web search, calculators, etc.). Agents can decide to call these tools as part of solving a task.
- Do you get them out of the box? Yes, LangChain provides a set of prebuilt tools, and you can easily add your own as well.

Common prebuilt tools you’ll see (examples; depending on your LangChain version and installed dependencies, names may vary):

- PythonREPLTool: run small Python code and return the result.
- CalculatorTool (or a Calculator-like tool): perform math calculations via a Python backend.
- Web search tools: wrappers around common search APIs (e.g., DuckDuckGo, SerpAPI, Google) that require API keys.
- Web fetch/tools: simple HTTP fetchers to retrieve page content or APIs.
- File/system tools: light wrappers to read files or run shell commands (use carefully).

How to use a built-in tool in an agent (typical pattern)

- You define a list of Tool objects (or use a ready-made tool list).
- You create an LLM and initialize an agent with those tools.
- The agent can decide to call a tool when needed.

Example using a Python REPL tool (typical, version-agnostic sketch):

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.tools import PythonREPLTool

# 1) Tools that the agent can call
tools = [PythonREPLTool()]

# 2) LLM
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.0)

# 3) Initialize a basic agent
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

# 4) Run a task
print(agent.run("Compute the following: 12 * (3 + 7)"))
```

Notes:

- You may need an OpenAI key and the right LangChain version. Tool availability can depend on installed extras.
- For web search tools, you typically install a wrapper (and provide an API key) like SerpAPI or DuckDuckGo wrappers. The exact import names may differ by version.

If you want a more concrete web search example, you’d commonly see something like:

```python
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchTool
tools = [DuckDuckGoSearchTool()]
```

but check your version’s docs for the exact class name and requirements.

2. Built-in memory options

- What memory does: It stores and reuses conversation history (so the model can refer to what happened earlier).
- Common built-in memory classes:
  - ConversationBufferMemory: stores each turn in memory; simple and very common.
  - ConversationBufferWindowMemory: keeps only the most recent N turns (helps with long chats).
  - ConversationSummaryMemory: maintains a concise summary of the conversation to keep context compact over long threads.

Usage examples:

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationBufferWindowMemory, ConversationSummaryMemory

# Simple, default memory (stores all turns)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

# Keep only the last 5 turns
window_memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(memory_key="chat_history", k=5, return_messages=True)

# Optional: summarize long conversations
summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(memory_key="chat_summary", llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.0))

# You’d pass one of these memory objects into your agent/chain initialization
```

3. Document loaders for txt, md, and pdf files

- What loaders do: They read content from files (or directories) and turn them into documents that LangChain can index, chunk, and embed for retrieval.

Common built-in document loaders:

- TextLoader: for plain TXT files
- MarkdownLoader: for MD files
- PyPDFLoader (or PDF loaders): for PDFs
- DirectoryLoader: to load an entire folder (recursively) of various file types
- Unstructured loaders: rely on the unstructured package to extract text from many formats (PDFs, Word, HTML, etc.)

Example usage:

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader, MarkdownLoader, PyPDFLoader, DirectoryLoader

# TXT file
txt = TextLoader("docs/intro.txt").load()

# Markdown file
md = MarkdownLoader("docs/guide.md").load()

# PDF file
pdf = PyPDFLoader("docs/manual.pdf").load()

# Load all files in a folder (recursively)
all_docs_loader = DirectoryLoader("docs/", glob="**/*.*")
docs = all_docs_loader.load()
```

Notes and caveats:

- Some loaders (especially PDF-related ones) rely on optional dependencies (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfminer, or the unstructured package). If you don’t have them installed, you’ll need to install the extra packages you plan to use.
- Unstructured-based loaders are powerful for mixed formats but can require extra setup (and can be slower).

4. Quick-start tips to get productive quickly

- Start small: aim to build a simple agent that can:
  - Ask a question and, if needed, call a Python REPL tool to compute something.
  - If you want grounding, add a document loader + a simple retrieval step (RAG) to answer from your docs.
- Use memory early: a ConversationBufferMemory lets you create a more natural chat experience and is easy to wire into a chain or agent.
- Keep dependencies lean: only install the tools you actually plan to use (e.g., PythonREPLTool and a specific web-search wrapper if you need web data).

5. Quick starter recipe (end-to-end pattern)

- Goal: a document-grounded chat with memory and a basic tool (Python calculation) available to the agent.

Code sketch (combine loaders, memory, and tools):

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# 1) Load docs
loader = DirectoryLoader("docs/", glob="**/*.md")  # or **/*.txt, **/*.pdf etc.
docs = loader.load()

# 2) Create embeddings + vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)

# 3) Retrieval QA chain (grounded answers)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever)

# 4) Memory for a chat-like feel
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

# 5) Simple loop (no full agent wiring shown)
def chat_with_docs(q: str):
    # You can also pass q into qa_chain if you want to ground with docs
    return qa_chain.run(q)

print(chat_with_docs("What are the main takeaways from these docs?"))
```

6. Quick guidance on what to install first

- Install LangChain and a backend:
  - pip install langchain
  - pip install openai
- Optional but common for a performant vector store:
  - pip install faiss-cpu (or faiss-gpu if you have a GPU)
  - pip install chromadb (alternative vector store)
- Optional: loaders dependencies (if you plan PDF/MD, etc.)
  - These may require extra packages (e.g., PyPDF2, unstructured). Install as you need them:
    - pip install PyPDF2
    - pip install unstructured

7. TL;DR

- Yes, LangChain provides built-in tools (for computation, web search, etc.) that agents can call. You’ll typically wire them up with an LLM via initialize_agent or in a chain.
- Yes, there are built-in memory options (ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationBufferWindowMemory, ConversationSummaryMemory) to maintain context.
- Yes, there are document loaders for TXT, MD, PDFs, and more (TextLoader, MarkdownLoader, PyPDFLoader, DirectoryLoader, and unstructured-based options).

If you’d like, tell me your target task (e.g., a doc-aware assistant, a web-enabled chat, or a math-focused bot) and your data format (texts, PDFs, MDs, a mix). I’ll give you a concrete, runnable starter snippet tailored to your setup, plus a minimal project structure you can grow.
